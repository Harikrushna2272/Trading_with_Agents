## 🔭 Overview
This project implements an AI trading agent using Deep Q-Learning, a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent learns to make trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on historical stock market data and technical indicators.

## ✨ Features
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) based trading agent
- Custom trading environment simulation
- Real-time stock data fetching using yfinance
- Technical indicators integration (SMA-5, SMA-20, Returns)
- Experience replay for improved learning
- Configurable hyperparameters for training
- Automated trading decision making
